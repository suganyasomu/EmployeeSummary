Suganya somu Employee Summary
=======

## Description

This is my Employee Summary, created using node.js and object-oriented programming.

## Process

I started out by running the given tests and correcting my constructor functions.  I wrote my app.js, and worked with getting recursive inquirer prompts to work. Finally, I figured out how to feed a Javascript with jQuery into my dynamically generated HTML file, which was the most frustrating.
